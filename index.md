### Getting Started

Software Engineering Daily is a place to learn about software, dream up new ideas, and meet people to build projects with.

We want you to find something that you will enjoy working on.

Here are some things you can do:
* Start building. If you know how to build your feature idea, start coding it up.
* Look at the [Product Ideas board](https://github.com/orgs/SoftwareEngineeringDaily/projects/1). This is where we throw out interesting feature ideas.
* Design and wireframe. We would love to see a visual representation of your idea.
* Fix bugs. We have bugs to smash in every repo.

> Feel free to send us a message at [help@softwareengineeringdaily.com](mailto:help@softwareengineeringdaily.com) if you need guidance.
