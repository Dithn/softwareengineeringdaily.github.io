### Getting Started

We want you to find something that you will enjoy working on.

Here are some things you can do:
* **Pick your technology from the options on the left and get started.** If you have any issues, please [contact us](mailto:help@softwareengineeringdaily.com).
* **Fix a "good first issue".** In each repository, we have issues labeled with [good first issue](https://github.com/SoftwareEngineeringDaily/sedaily-front-end/labels/good%20first%20issue). These will help you understand our codebase while also helping us out!
* **Look at the "brainstorming" section of [our roadmap](roadmap).** This is where we explore feature ideas.
* **Design and wireframe, then [share your idea in Slack](http://softwaredaily.herokuapp.com/).** We would love to see a visual representation of your idea.
* **Start building.** If you know how to build your feature idea, start coding it up.
