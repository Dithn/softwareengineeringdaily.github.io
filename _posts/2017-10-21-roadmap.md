title: In Progress

**High-level features we are working on and features we have committed to implementing**

> See our [roadmap on Github](https://github.com/orgs/SoftwareEngineeringDaily/projects/1). If you have an idea for a feature, [email us](mailto:ideas@softwareengineeringdaily.com) or [join Slack](http://softwaredaily.herokuapp.com/)!

# **In Progress** #

_Code has been written for these features._

### Comments ###

Users will be able to add comments to podcast episodes. First implementation will be simple, unthreaded comments.

### Profile Page ###

Users will be able to add a profile. First iteration will require users to add first and last names, and will have the option to add a profile picture.



# **Planned** #

_We are committed to building these features, but no code has been written._

### AMA ###

Guests will be able to answer listener questions in an "AMA" format similar to [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/). After a guest comes on the show, we should create an AMA section where listeners can ask the guest questions.

### Link sharing ###

Users will be able to add links that are related to episodes they listen to. This will allow us to crowdsource related information. For example, an episode about TypeScript at Slack should have a feature where anyone can add links related to a podcast episode.

Anyone can add links--this will create a wiki-like environment.

### Percentage Episode Finished ###

We need to track how long each user makes it through each episode.

One way is to log the farthest timestamp that a user makes it to. Then, divide that by the length of the episode. That will give you a double representing the percentage of the episode that the user listened to.

This is a useful signal for how interested a given user is in a given topic.

### Feed View ###

Users spend hours per week listening to SE Daily. We can use listener data to suggest content that would be relevant to the user based on their listening habits.

The simple vision for this involves the "link sharing" feature. Let's say the user has listened to 80% of the "TypeScript at Slack" episode. We can recommend the links that are shared in the "TypeScript at Slack" link sharing section.

The architecture for this will be fun to build. We will need to generate a custom feed for every user.

### Question Crowdsourcing Tool ###

Before every show, listeners should be able to submit questions they would like to hear the answers to.

### Episode Quizzes ###

After every show, listeners should be able to take a short multiple choice quiz to test their retention of key points from the show.

### Global Event Log ###

We should make a global event log to decouple event creation from writing to the database. That will make it easier for people to build applications on top of SE Daily infrastructure.

### 1-Click Environment Creation ###

New contributors should be able to easily create a new environment and start making changes. We should make this as fast as possible. Investigate using [Cloud Nine](c9.io).

### Flexible Recommendation System ###

We need to build a recommendation system that can suggest podcasts, content, other users to follow, etc.
