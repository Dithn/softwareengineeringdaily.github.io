# **In Progress** #

### Forum ###

We are building a forum for SED users to interact.

### Profile Page ###

Users have a public profile with basic information. We need to give people the option to add personal Github and Twitter links.

### Monitoring and Analytics ###

We are building an analytics dashboard and monitoring system to better understand what is going on.

See [sedaily-devops](https://github.com/SoftwareEngineeringDaily/sedaily-devops) for more.

### Notifications ###

We want to subscribe people to notifications of responses to their comments in forums, and give them the option to unsubscribe to those notification channels.
