**High-level features we are working on and features we have committed to implementing**

> See our [roadmap on Github](https://github.com/SoftwareEngineeringDaily/softwareengineeringdaily.github.io/projects/1). If you have an idea for a feature, [email us](mailto:ideas@softwareengineeringdaily.com) or [join Slack](http://softwaredaily.herokuapp.com/)!

# **In Progress** #

### Newsfeed ###

Users spend hours per week listening to SE Daily. We can use listener data to suggest content that would be relevant to the user based on their listening habits.

See the [newsfeed section](/newsfeed/roadmap) for more.

### Profile Page ###

Users have a profile with basic information. We need to make it public, and add more interactivity.

### Event Log ###

We are building a global event log to decouple event creation from writing to the database. That will make it easier for people to build applications on top of SE Daily infrastructure.

See [sedaily-event-stream](https://github.com/SoftwareEngineeringDaily/sedaily-event-stream) for more.

# **Planned** #

_We are committed to building these features, but no code has been written._

### AMA ###

Guests will be able to answer listener questions in an "AMA" format similar to [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/). After a guest comes on the show, we should create an AMA section where listeners can ask the guest questions.

AMA can reuse the code for commenting that we have already implemented.


### Question Crowdsourcing Tool ###

Before every show, listeners should be able to submit questions they would like to hear the answers to.

### Episode Quizzes ###

After every show, listeners should be able to take a short multiple choice quiz to test their retention of key points from the show.


### 1-Click Environment Creation ###

New contributors should be able to easily create a new environment and start making changes. We should make this as fast as possible. One idea to investigate is using [Cloud Nine](c9.io).

### Flexible Recommendation System ###

We need to build a recommendation system that can suggest podcasts, content, other users to follow, etc.
