_To get started quickly, we recommend communicating with the backend API instance hosted in Heroku. Play around with it for awhile, then consider [setting up the backend locally]()._

### Style Guide
The [VueJS Style Guide](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/) is a standard we try to maintain.

### Testing
>Pull requests must have some testing around them. Donâ€™t be afraid to ask for help with writing tests!

#### End-to-end Browser Testing
We use [Nightwatch](http://nightwatchjs.org/gettingstarted) to write end-to-end browser tests. Nightwatch is powered by Selenium, a common testing tool.
