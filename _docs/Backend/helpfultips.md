If you are already running mongo locally make sure to stop it if you want to interface with the docker mongo database using something like [RoboMongo](https://robomongo.org/)

### Helpful commands: ###

*If using brew*

>brew services list

>brew services stop mongodb

>brew services start mongodb

*A few other helpful tips for docker are that you can see which containers are running and ssh into them:*
>docker container ls

*Since we are running a command when docker starts you need to create a new bash shell when you ssh:*

>sudo docker exec -i -t CONTAINER_ID_HERE  /bin/bash

*To start the server do this inside of the backend repo:*

>docker-compose up

*To shut it down use:*

>docker-compose down

*To run another configuration for docker use:*

>docker-compose -f  docker.alt.yml  up

### Note for running the tests: ###
docker-compose.test.yml NEEDS to have docker-compose up before or redis wont be available
Also note your database gets cleared on docker down:
Your .env file will differ if running inside docker vs locally.  Change redis to be ‘localhost’ and mongo ip to also be localhost.
