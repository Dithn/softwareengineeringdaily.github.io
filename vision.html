  <h2>Values</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Nobody works for anyone. We work with each other.</li>
    <li>Mutual investment. When we invest in others that investment comes back compounded.</li>
    <li>Creativity for yourself and others. Your work should energize you. Our products should inspire users.</li>
    <li>Optimistic determinism. Decide what future you would like to see then execute the proper actions.</li>
    <li>Patience over panic. The worst mistakes come from reactive impulses.</li>
    <li>Quantify expected value. Take risks with high potential upside and low maximum downside.</li>
    <li>Long term thinking. If you donâ€™t know what you want you are unlikely to get it.</li>
    <li>An idea without action is opinion. </li>
  </ol>
