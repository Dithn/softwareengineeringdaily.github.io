  <h2>Values</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Nobody works for anyone.</b> We work with each other.</li>
    <li><b>Mutual investment.</b> When we invest in others that investment comes back compounded.</li>
    <li><b>Creativity for yourself and others.</b> Your work should energize you. Our product should inspire users.</li>
    <li><b>Optimistic determinism.</b> Decide what future you would like to see then execute the proper actions.</li>
    <li><b>Patience over panic.</b> The worst mistakes come from reactive impulses.</li>
    <li><b>Quantify expected value.</b> Take risks with high potential upside and low maximum downside.</li>
    <li><b>Long term thinking.</b> If you donâ€™t know what you want you are unlikely to get it.</li>
    <li><b>An idea without action is opinion.</b></li>
  </ol>
